  <h1>LAWRENCE BLAIR</h1>
</div>

  <p class="text-box1">
  For more than 40 years, this English-born, Bali-based anthropologist and explorer has
  been participating and leading marine expeditions throughout the Indonesian archipelago.
  The second time he visited, back in 1972, was with his now late brother Lorne and some
  funding from Ringo Starr. Their mission? To make a documen­tary series-the groundbreaking
  Ring of Fire-that included encounters with cannibal headhunters and the funeral ceremony
  for the last king of the Toraja people, who believe their ancestors were descended from
  the stars. These days much of his time is split between hosting private yacht charters
  (he once did a submersible dive in Raja Ampat Islands with Oxford professor Richard Dawkins)
  and lecturing on National Geographic and Silversea cruises. But this fall Blaft will be
  aboard the eight-cabin Kudantl Explorer-an experienced expedition ship whose crew know
  exactly where the best surf spots are-as it sails to the Banda Islands, his all-time
  favorite castaway destination.

  <h1>OPRAH WINFREY</h1>

  <p class="text-box2">
  She might be considered the godmother of many things: talk shows, self-help, female
  empowerment-the list goes on. And now one of the nation's richest self­made women, once
  dubbed the queen of all media, is. the official godmother of a cruise ship, Holland
  America's 2,650-passenger Nieuw Statendam. When she launched the ship with a one-off
  Girls Getaway cruise to the Caribbean earlier this year, it sold out in minutes, barely
  longer than the standing ovation after her rousing speech at last year's Golden Globes.
  Now guests get a series of programs inspired by 0, The Oprah Magazine, from meaningful
  meditation and energizing movement sessions by the pool to O-approved transformational
  videos and an Oprah Reading Room, a nod to her wildly influential book club. Winfrey has
  been working with Holland America for a few years, curating a series of Adventure of Your
  Life voyages, most recently a trip to Alaska with experts including "wisdom teacher"
  Shefali Tsabary and sound-bathing therapist Sara Auster. Cruising, like politics, television,
  and social media, has entered Oprah's orbit.
